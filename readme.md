# PRAGATI

## Description:

PRAGATI is a multilingual, AI-powered voice assistant designed to make welfare payments and government schemes instantly verifiable and accessible for rural and semi-urban citizens. It reduces the economic and social burden of repeated bank trips by providing a simple, local, and verifiable way to check financial status, withdrawals, and scheme eligibility—all in the user’s native language.

## Key Features and Highlights:

* **Multilingual Support** – Seamless interaction in multiple Indian languages.
* **Voice Integration at Kiosk** – Accessible even with low end/resourse limited kiosk.
* **Financial Status Verification** – Instantly check if DBT credits (NREGA, PM-Kisan, pensions, etc.) have arrived.
* **Lightweight AI Agents** – AI agents designed for inclusivity and scalability, by using lite-weight stt and tts models.
* **User-Centered Design** – Built to address real struggles of elderly, women, and daily-wage earners.

## Inspiration:

The idea came from real experiences in rural India—watching pensioners and daily-wage earners walk 8–10 km, spend ₹40–₹80 on travel, and wait hours in queues just to ask one question: *“Has my money come?”*
This repeated effort costs families over ₹1300 per month, excluding lost wages, and impacts over 134 million rural/semi-urban Indians who rely on DBT subsidies. PRAGATI was created to restore dignity, save time, and remove anxiety by offering a local, instant, and accessible verification system.
